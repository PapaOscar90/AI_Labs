Problem 3 - Genetic
Chose a fitness function that increases the chance of selection based on how low it's fitness score is (conflicts). The formula is:
((n*(n-1))/fitness)*10. This makes a rough percent chance based on the number of conflicts against the possible total conflicts.
So lowest possible score could get a 100% chance of being selected. This allows very promising chromosomes to be selected quite often.
No chromosome can be selected twice by passing in the last index selected. This would just make a child of the same chromosome and a cycle.

The mutation is a 7% chance per queen per person to be changed to a random position. This had the best overall performance of the trials.

Reproduce picks a random location to split the strings between X and Y. This could be improved possibly by giving the better fitted one more queens.
